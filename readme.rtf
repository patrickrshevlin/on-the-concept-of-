This started as the least amount of code needed to install a wordpress theme. You will have a single page, to have more pages more .php files are needed.  To fully intagrate with wordpress you will need more .php, .css, and html work.
Feel free to build what ever you like.  If you use the code, consider leaving a link to the github.
