part nostalgia, part fuck it all. a free theme for wordpress. designed to offer limited functionality, but of course can be built into anything you desire.  this is the minimum amount of code needed to overide default wordpress themes and create a single page website, other .php files and edits to style.css are needed for your site to work with all of the wordpress plugins and features. edits must be made in the theme editor (appearence> theme editor) using html and css.  please feel free to edit the theme in anyway, but consider leaving a link to the githud somewhere on your page or in the page code. 
sincerely,
patrick
